If the secondary hardware has insufficient memory to keep the read working set in memory, directing reads to it will likely slow it down.
You may not read what you previously wrote to MongoDB on a secondary because it will lag behind by some amount.
If your write traffic is great enough, and your secondary is less powerful than the primary, you may overwhelm the secondary, which must process all the writes as well as the reads. Replication lag can result.
